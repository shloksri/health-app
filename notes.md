    Let's go over each feature in detail, focusing on user-centered design, and how to balance simplicity and effectiveness.

### 1. Mood Tracker
   - **Core Functionality**: Users should be able to log their mood daily and tag it with reasons or activities that affected it.
   - **Mood Types**: We can include a simple set of moods that cover a broad spectrum without overwhelming the user. Examples might be:
     - **Happy**: Feeling content, joyful, or optimistic.
     - **Sad**: Feeling low, disappointed, or melancholic.
     - **Anxious**: Feeling worried, stressed, or tense.
     - **Angry**: Feeling frustrated, irritated, or resentful.
     - **Neutral**: Feeling indifferent, stable, or balanced.
     - **Excited**: Feeling thrilled, enthusiastic, or eager.
     - **Tired**: Feeling drained, exhausted, or low-energy.
   - **Mood Descriptions**: Provide a brief description of each mood to help users choose accurately. For example, clicking "Happy" could bring up "Content and joyful, feeling positive or satisfied today."
   - **Tags**: Allow users to add tags like "Work," "Family," or "Self-care." This can help them reflect on which areas affect their moods most over time.
   - **Design Considerations**: Use a simple emoji or icon system for moods to make it quick to log. Consider a calendar view to visually track mood trends over time.

### 2. Daily Journal
   - **Core Functionality**: Provide a space for users to freely write about their thoughts and feelings each day.
   - **Privacy**: Highlight that entries are private and secure. Offer a “lock” or “privacy” icon to remind users of confidentiality.
   - **Mood Tagging**: If a user logs a mood, prompt them to journal about it (optional) to encourage self-reflection.
   - **Date Stamping**: Each entry should be dated, with a simple option to navigate previous entries for reflection.
   - **Design Considerations**: Keep it minimal with a clean, distraction-free text area. You could add a character count or word limit to encourage concise entries and reduce overwhelm.

### 3. Mental Health Resources
   - **Core Functionality**: Offer curated links to reliable articles, hotlines, and self-help guides focused on mental health.
   - **Categories**: Organize resources into categories like "Anxiety," "Depression," "Stress Management," and "Self-care Tips."
   - **Trusted Sources**: Ensure the links lead to reputable organizations like the WHO, NIMH, or similar, for credibility.
   - **Offline Access**: Consider offering a “Save for Later” option so users can mark certain resources and view them offline.
   - **Design Considerations**: Each resource could be displayed as a clickable card with a brief description. Limit the number of resources per category to maintain simplicity.

### 4. Reminders
   - **Core Functionality**: Allow users to set personalized reminders for mood logging or journaling.
   - **Types of Reminders**: Enable options like daily mood check-ins, end-of-day reflections, or weekly journaling prompts.
   - **Customization**: Allow flexible scheduling, such as “Every day at 8 PM” or “Mondays and Fridays.”
   - **Design Considerations**: Keep the reminder setup page simple, using toggles and time pickers to select days and times.

=============


can you elaborate on Mental health app. Give me two versions of this app. First is simple app, and the second one is AI powered. Focus on all areas about how I can architect the app in both scenarios. Also, add which AI tool and other related tools I can use. Please explain detail



=============================


--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
let's go with each core feature one by one. All the moods you have described, can you add some more moods to it? Please make sure that these are the common types of mood a person can have. Also, I want you to create one-liners related to the mood. For example, if someone is feeling sad, the one-liner could be "Sorry to hear that. Let us know why". But these one liners should be kind and according to the mood. We will use these one-liners later in the code.



I am building this app using React as frontend. I will also be using the Pink design system by Appwrite. Let's start with Mood tracker. Please write the react component code for this. Please use the moods and one-liners you suggested above. I want this to be a simple form which contains 4 elements. Feel free to add a soothing css for this component as well. If you can use the Pink design system by Appwrite, it will be great. The app will have 4 sections. First is a dropdown to select the mood. Second is a small space below it which is by default blank and will highlight the one-liners. This space should not be highlighted explicitly. The user should not feel uncomfortable when the message is displayed. So the one liner should not be a popup. Rather, it can look like it's being typed in that small section. Add the transition and everything in the css. If no mood is selected, it will just be a blank space. But make sure the spaces between each section are equal. So basically when the one-liner start showing, it should not look like the form has changed. Also, if the user decided to change the mood before submitting it, a new one-liner should start getting displayed. Third section is the text space with no character limit, where user can enter why they are feeling like this. Basically, a small reason about it. Fourth section will be an option to write a journal about it. Show a message below this option so that they know the meaning of it. If they select yes, then they will be redirected to it only and only after they submit the form.
At last there should be a button to submit their moods. If the user has selected yes to write a journal, it should redirect to another page, named Your Journals. Make sure you prevent the default behaviour of forms, so that the user can only submit the form when they manually click on submit. Also, please make sure you have header or footer, o some section which says all the data the user is entering is completely private and will not be shared with anyone.


I need you to write the code for App component named Home, which is an SPA and contains all the routes to all the webpages. This component content will be like this -  A box at the centre of the page with a question asking "what do you want to do today?". Then below show these options. Make sure these options are buttons and not dropdowns. Write the css of buttons in a way that they don't look like buttons. Each of these buttons will be having a hover over effect which will describe the feature in a simple one line. Feel free to create the description as you want. Also feel free to change the labels of these buttons to match the sentiment of any general user.
First button is Mood Tracker. Second button is Your Daily Journals. Third will be Emotional Well-being Resources. Fourth will be Reminders. Each of these buttons will take user to a different component of our app. Define the routes as well. Following will be the routes to each feature - mood-tracker, journals, resources, reminders. I will give you the structure  for each separate component later on.


Journals -

Let's code the next part - Journals. The journal page should have 3 components. 

First should be a button to create a new journal. This button should have a label and should be at the centre of the page. This should redirect to a page where user can add their journal. We can call this component as YourJournal. 

Second should be a list of all journals user has entered in the past. Create a json file and write 2-3 journals there. Let's name it as journals.json. Each object in this file should have following keys - 
1. username, 
2. journalID - id of journal,
3. moodID - ID of mood if any, 
4. mood - happy, sad, anxious, etc, 
5. date - the date when journal was created, 
6. time - the time when journal was created
7. content - content that user entered in the journal.

Each time the user clicks on Journals from the Home page, the data should be fetched from this json file. The list of journals should have their date and time as headers of the journal and first few lines of their entered text. The displaying of journals should be sorted according to the date, the last one showing up as the first entry.

For the YourJournal component, It should be a simple form where user can enter their mood through a dropdown. You can use the same dropdown and one-liners we created in MoodTracker. Then there should be a text box where user can write a full paragraph of how they are feeling, with no character limit. Please make the css of this form look good. It should not look like some default html text tag. Also, spread the whole form to the full width of the page, with some good margin on the sides. There should be a Save your Journal button in the last. When the user Submits the button, an new journal ID should be created, the local json file should get updated and the user should be redirected to Journals page. Here, the new journal created by user should be displayed.

The second feature of this YourJournal component - In the MoodTracker component, when user clicks submit after checking the checkbox "Would you like to write a journal about this?", it should create a new mood ID, and send it as props to YourJournal component. So then, the dropdown is already filled with the same mood and is unchangeable, that means if user has been redirected from MoodTracker to YourJournal, they will not be able to change the mood on that page. When the user submits the form in YourJournal component, the journals.json file should get updated. Make the changes in MoodTracker component.

The mood ID will be a combination of mood of the user in small letters (happy, sad, anxious, etc.) plus the date and time the user entered it. The format can be like happy_01012024_1754, where happy is the mood, 01012024 is the date meaning 1st January 2024, and 1754 is the time, meaning 5.54 PM. If the user was redirected from the MoodTracker page, only then generate the mood ID, otherwise not.

For journal ID, it can be a simple count, like journal_1, journal_2, etc.

The third and final component for this Journals page should be ViewYourJournal. This is the component which basically shows the details entered in the journal. The top heading will be date and time, the second will be mood. The third will be the content enetered by the user. Please take care of the routes. Let's say the id of the journal is journal_45, so the route link should have that id, so that it becomes easy to navigate. There should be a back button in the last, which will redirect the user to Journals page.
